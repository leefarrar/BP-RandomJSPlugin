#PyRand plugin for Boundary Premium
This plugin serves no practical monitoring use. Unless you need to display a random set of numbers between a certain range, for some reason...

Quick reference implementation of using a non js monitoring script,
taking params, and also using an icon. Because *rock*.

This will never be merged into the main Boundary plugins system, so add to your private account using:

$ curl https://premium-api.boundary.com/v1/plugins/private/myplugin/myusername/mypluginrepo \
-X PUT \
-u <email>:<api-token>

All features used are documented here: http://premium-documentation.boundary.com/plugins
